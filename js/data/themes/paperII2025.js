            question: 'Discuss the \'corrupt practices\' for the purpose of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Analyze whether the increase in the assets of the legislators and/or their associates, disproportionate to their known sources of income, would constitute \'undue influence\' and consequently a corrupt practice. 150 words',
            paragraph: `The Representation of the People Act, 1951 seeks to ensure free and fair elections by prohibiting practices that distort the voter's free will. Corrupt practices are those acts that undermine the purity of the electoral process.

As per Section 123 of the Act, the following constitute corrupt practices:

1. Bribery – Offering or accepting gratification to influence voting behaviour.

2. Undue influence – Interfering with the free exercise of the voter's choice through threat or coercion.

3. Appeal on religious, caste, communal, or linguistic grounds to secure votes.

4. Publication of false statements regarding a candidate's personal character or conduct.

5. Misuse of government machinery for electioneering purposes.

6. Hiring or procuring vehicles for voters and exceeding prescribed election expenses.

An increase in the assets of legislators or their associates, disproportionate to their known income, does not automatically amount to a corrupt practice, unless it is proven that the wealth was used to exercise undue influence or inducement over voters. Such enrichment, though unethical, is dealt with under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and not Section 123 of the RPA.`

    question: 'Comment on the need of administrative tribunals as compared to the court system. Assess the impact of the recent tribunal reforms through rationalization of tribunals made in 2021. 150 words.',
    paragraph: `Administrative tribunals were created to ensure speedy, specialized, and less formal adjudication in administrative and service-related disputes. The regular courts, burdened with delays and procedural rigidity, often failed to provide timely justice in such matters. Tribunals thus act as quasi-judicial bodies combining legal and technical expertise, promoting efficiency and accessibility.

Need for tribunals compared to courts:

1. Specialized expertise – Subject-matter experts handle complex technical cases.

2. Speed and efficiency – Simplified procedures and reduced backlog.

3. Affordability – Less costly and time-consuming than traditional litigation.

4. Judicial relief – Reduces the burden on constitutional courts.

The Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, aimed to rationalize the system by merging tribunals with overlapping functions, streamlining appointments, and standardizing service conditions. While this reform enhanced administrative efficiency, critics argue it reduced judicial independence by vesting greater control with the executive, thereby raising concerns about separation of powers under Article 50.`

    question: 'Compare and contrast the President\'s power to pardon in India and in the USA. Are there any limits to it in both the countries? What are \'preemptive pardons\'?',
    paragraph: `In India, the President’s power to grant pardons is derived from Article 72 of the Constitution. It extends to offences under Union laws, court-martial cases, and death sentences. The President acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, making the power not absolute. Judicial review is allowed if the decision is arbitrary, mala fide, or discriminatory, as affirmed in Maru Ram v. Union of India (1980).

In contrast, the U.S. President enjoys broader clemency powers under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. The American President can independently grant reprieves, commutations, or pardons for federal offences, except in cases of impeachment. The courts generally cannot review the exercise of this power, giving it a near-absolute character.

Preemptive pardons are those granted before formal charges or conviction, effectively protecting individuals from future prosecution, as famously seen in President Ford’s pardon of Nixon.`

    question: '"The Attorney General of India plays a crucial role in guiding the legal framework of the Union Government and ensuring sound governance through legal counsel." Discuss his responsibilities, rights and limitations in this regard.',
    paragraph: `The Attorney General of India (AGI) is the chief legal advisor to the Union, appointed under Article 76 of the Constitution.

Responsibilities (Article 76(2)):
Give legal advice to the Government of India on matters referred or assigned by the President.
Perform other legal duties and functions conferred by the Constitution or by any law of Parliament.

Rights:
Right of audience in all courts in the territory of India for effective representation (Article 76(3)).
Right to speak and take part in the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament, including joint sittings, and to participate in parliamentary committees where he may be named a member, but without the power to vote (Article 88).

Limitations:
Holds office during the pleasure of the President and remuneration is determined by the President (Article 76(4)).
Lacks security of tenure, limiting full independence from the executive.
By professional ethics cannot appear against the Government of India or take briefs causing conflict of interest.

Thus, the AGI supports constitutional governance while bound by executive control.`

    question: "Women's social capital complements in advancing empowerment and gender equity. Explain.",
    paragraph: `Women’s social capital refers to the networks, community bonds, collective solidarity, and mutual support systems that women cultivate through family, neighbourhoods, self-help groups, workplaces, and digital platforms. It acts as a powerful complement to constitutional and legal measures for empowerment.

How women’s social capital advances empowerment and gender equity:

Collective voice: Shared networks allow women to articulate concerns, negotiate rights, and resist gender-based discrimination.

Economic empowerment: Through self-help groups and cooperatives, women gain access to credit, entrepreneurial opportunities, and market linkages, enhancing their autonomy.

Access to information: Peer networks spread awareness of legal rights, government schemes, education and health services.

Leadership development: Community participation builds confidence and encourages women to take roles in local governance, especially Panchayats.

Social protection: Emotional and practical support systems reduce vulnerability to domestic violence, exclusion, and socio-economic shocks.

Thus, women’s social capital reinforces institutional efforts by strengthening agency, participation, and dignity, making gender equity a community-driven and sustainable process rather than relying solely on state intervention.`

    question: "E-governance projects have a built-in bias towards technology and back-end integration rather than user-centric designs. Examine.",
    paragraph: `E-governance in India often emphasizes digital infrastructure over citizen-friendly service delivery.

Bias toward technology:

Standardizing procedures rather than simplifying services: Many portals replicate old paperwork digitally (e.g., property registration still demands multiple digital uploads).

Capturing data rather than safeguarding privacy: Aadhaar-based systems expand rapidly while data protection frameworks lag.

Enforcing compliance rather than enabling convenience: GST systems push strict filing schedules, burdening small traders with low digital skills.

Promoting digital channels over multi-channel access: Mandatory online pension authentication excludes people lacking stable internet/biometrics.

Neglect of user-centric design:

Ignoring digital literacy gaps: CSCs remain intermediaries instead of empowering direct citizen access.

Overlooking accessibility and linguistic diversity: RTI and grievance portals often limit access through English-dominant interfaces.

Excluding vulnerable groups: Beneficiaries like sanitation workers lack devices for online rehabilitation schemes.

Conclusion: For inclusive governance, India must move from technology-driven rollout toward co-created, hybrid, and context-specific design that enhances accessibility, trust, and last-mile service delivery.`

    question: "Civil Society Organisations are often perceived as being anti-State actors than non-State actors. Do you agree? Justify.",
    paragraph: `Civil society organisations (CSOs) strengthen democracy by representing citizen interests, demanding accountability and safeguarding rights in a plural and diverse society. Yet, their frequent criticism of government actions, mobilisation of protests and exposure of corruption creates a strong perception of them as adversaries of the state rather than complementary actors in governance. Governments often equate dissent with disloyalty, especially in politically sensitive sectors like land acquisition, environment and human rights, further intensifying mistrust toward such organisations.

Moreover, foreign funding of some CSOs raises specific concerns of external intervention in domestic policy priorities, leading to tighter scrutiny under regulations like FCRA and greater suspicion about their intentions. Such fears reinforce claims that they may challenge national interests while asserting public rights.

However, CSOs fundamentally operate within constitutional frameworks and seek to improve governance outcomes. Their role as watchdogs is essential to a healthy democracy. The perception of them being anti-state persists due to their accountability-based engagement, not due to any inherent hostility toward the state.`

    question: "India-Africa digital partnership is achieving mutual respect, co-development and long-term institutional partnerships. Elaborate.",
    paragraph: `India-Africa digital partnership is emerging as a key pillar of South-South cooperation, based on mutual respect, shared development priorities and long-term institutional collaboration. India supports African countries through affordable digital technologies like Aadhaar-based identity systems, UPI-style payment solutions, and platforms for tele-education and tele-medicine. Initiatives such as Pan-African e-Network, International Solar Alliance’s digital tools and Digital Public Infrastructure cooperation strengthen capacity-building and enable inclusive service delivery across sectors.

Africa benefits from India’s experience in bridging digital divides, developing low-cost innovation and training skilled human resources. India, in turn, gains strategic partnerships, enhanced markets, and long-term goodwill rooted in historical solidarity. Collaboration on cyber security, digital governance standards, start-up incubation and fintech further deepens institutional linkages.

Thus, the partnership moves beyond donor-recipient dynamics to co-creation of solutions, empowering both sides to harness the digital revolution for economic growth, social development and stronger global voice.`

    question: "With the waning of globalisation, post-Cold War world is becoming a site of sovereign nationalism. Elucidate.",
    paragraph: `The post-Cold War period initially promised a borderless world driven by globalisation, economic interdependence, and liberal values. Yet, this ideal is waning as sovereign nationalism resurges worldwide. States increasingly prioritise self-reliance, national security, and policy autonomy over unrestricted global integration.

Events like Brexit, America’s protectionism, and China’s techno-nationalism reflect growing resistance to global institutions perceived as limiting sovereignty. Developing nations too pursue localisation and strategic autonomy through initiatives like “Atmanirbhar Bharat.” The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia–Ukraine conflict further reinforced the need for resilient supply chains and self-sufficiency.

Sovereign nationalism today redefines globalisation — from universal liberalism to transactional cooperation based on national interest. Border control, data sovereignty, and domestic industry revival exemplify this guarded approach.

Thus, the post-Cold War world witnesses not the death of globalisation but its recalibration. The new order is marked by selective interdependence, regional alignments, and pragmatic nationalism replacing earlier faith in global economic convergence.`

    question: "\"Constitutional morality is the fulcrum which acts as an essential check upon the high functionaries and citizens alike....\" In view of the above observation of the Supreme Court, explain the concept of constitutional morality and its application to ensure balance between judicial independence and judicial accountability in India.",
    paragraph: `Constitutional morality, as articulated by the Supreme Court, is the foundational ethic and the essential \"fulcrum\" of Indian democracy. It represents a shared commitment by all institutions and citizens to the cardinal values of the Constitution—justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. This concept acts as a vital balancing point, checking the potential tyranny of state power and the possible excesses of majoritarian sentiment, thereby preserving the delicate architecture of the republic.

In the context of the judiciary, constitutional morality is the guiding principle that ensures a sustainable equilibrium between judicial independence and judicial accountability.

Judicial Independence is protected because constitutional morality demands that judges be insulated from executive interference and populist pressures. This insulation, achieved through security of tenure and the collegium system, is not for the benefit of judges themselves, but to empower them to protect minority rights and individual liberties against potential state overreach. Furthermore, it imposes a duty upon citizens to respect judicial authority, fostering a culture where legal processes are trusted over mob sentiment, thus ensuring the courtroom remains a sanctuary of reasoned deliberation.

Simultaneously, constitutional morality enforces Judicial Accountability, ensuring the judiciary does not become an unaccountable oligarchy. Judges are accountable not to the government or popular opinion, but to the Constitution itself. This accountability is operationalised through several mechanisms: the requirement for reasoned judgments that are open to scholarly and public scrutiny; the restrained use of contempt powers to allow for legitimate criticism; and the existence of internal investigative procedures to address allegations of misconduct.

Therefore, constitutional morality ensures the judiciary functions as a robust, independent guardian of the Constitution while remaining a disciplined institution accountable to its spirit. This balance, orchestrated by constitutional morality, is indispensable for the legitimacy and endurance of India's constitutional democracy.`

    question: "Indian Constitution has conferred the amending power on the ordinary legislative institutions with a few procedural hurdles. In view of this statement, examine the procedural and substantive limitations on the amending power of the Parliament to change the Constitution.",
    paragraph: `The Constitution makers vested the power of amendment in India’s ordinary legislative institutions rather than creating a separate constituent body, reflecting their belief in a flexible yet safeguarded constitutional order. However, this amending power under Article 368 is subject to procedural as well as substantive limitations to prevent the erosion of constitutional identity.

Procedural limitations include special majority requirements in both Houses— a majority of the total membership and two-thirds of members present and voting. For federal features, additional ratification by at least half of the State Legislatures is mandatory, covering provisions like the election of the President, distribution of legislative powers, judiciary, and representation of states in Parliament. Further, the bill must be introduced only in Parliament, not in state legislatures, and must receive Presidential assent. These hurdles ensure deliberation, wider consensus, and federal participation in constitutional change.

Substantive limitations arise primarily from judicial interpretation. In the Kesavananda Bharati (1973) judgment, the Supreme Court held that Parliament’s power is wide but not unlimited, restricting amendments that damage or destroy the Basic Structure of the Constitution. Features such as the supremacy of the Constitution, republican and democratic form of government, secularism, federalism, judicial review, balance between fundamental rights and directive principles, and free and fair elections are beyond Parliament’s amending reach. Subsequent judgments, including Minerva Mills and SR Bommai, reinforced that amendments cannot convert limited powers into absolute authority or alter the fundamental character of the polity.

Thus, while the Constitution enables adaptation through parliamentary amendment, procedural rigour and substantive judicial safeguards jointly ensure that constitutional continuity, identity and core democratic principles remain inviolable.`

    question: "Discuss the evolution of collegium system in India. Critically examine the advantages and disadvantages of the system of appointment of the Judges of the Supreme Court of India and that of the USA.",
    paragraph: `The collegium system in India evolved through judicial interpretation rather than constitutional text. Initially, under Articles 124 and 217, the President appointed judges in “consultation” with the Chief Justice of India (CJI). In the First Judges Case (1981), the Supreme Court held that the executive had primacy in appointments. This shifted dramatically in the Second Judges Case (1993), where the Court introduced the collegium, giving primacy to the judiciary in recommending names. The Third Judges Case (1998) clarified its composition— a five-member body for Supreme Court appointments and a three-member body for High Courts. The NJAC Act (2014) sought to replace the collegium with a mixed body, but the Supreme Court struck it down for violating judicial independence, reaffirming collegium primacy.

The collegium system’s advantages include insulation of appointments from political influence, protection of judicial independence, and continuity of institutional values. It prevents partisan capture of the judiciary, a concern in countries with majoritarian governments. However, its disadvantages include opacity, absence of defined criteria, limited diversity, and allegations of nepotism. The lack of formal accountability mechanisms raises concerns about transparency and public trust.

In the United States, Supreme Court judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Advantages include transparency through public confirmation hearings, clear constitutional processes, and democratic accountability. Yet, this system is vulnerable to political polarisation, ideological vetting, and strategic retirements, often resulting in courts reflecting partisan divides.

Thus, while India’s collegium protects independence, it suffers from opacity; the U.S. system promotes transparency but risks politicisation. A balanced reform model for India would preserve independence while enhancing transparency and objective selection criteria.`

    question: "Examine the evolving pattern of Centre-State financial relations in the context of planned development in India. How far have the recent reforms impacted the fiscal federalism in India?",
    paragraph: `The evolving pattern of Centre-State financial relations in India, shaped by planned development, reflects a persistent trend of centralization, albeit with recent reforms attempting to rebalance fiscal federalism.

Evolution in the Context of Planned Development:

The era of planned development, initiated with the Five-Year Plans, cemented the Centre's dominance. The Planning Commission, a non-constitutional body, became the principal architect of national priorities and the allocator of resources to states. This created a channel of funds outside the Finance Commission's recommendations, making states financially dependent on the Centre for plan assistance. The centralization of major tax powers (like Income Tax and Excise Duties) and the proliferation of centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) further constrained states' fiscal autonomy, tailoring their development agendas to national blueprints rather than local needs.

Impact of Recent Reforms:

Recent reforms have significantly impacted this dynamic, with mixed outcomes for fiscal federalism:

Positive Impacts:
1. Abolition of the Planning Commission: Its replacement with NITI Aayog ended the patron-client relationship for plan funds, symbolically enhancing cooperative federalism.
2. GST Council: The GST regime, governed by a federal Council with states having a significant voice, is a landmark in cooperative decision-making. It has created a unified national market.
3. Finance Commission Recommendations: The sharp rise in the states’ share of the divisible tax pool—mandated at 42% by the 14th Finance Commission—marked a major step towards fiscal devolution.
Persisting Challenges:
1. Centralized Fiscal Power: The Centre retains control over direct taxes and corporation tax, the most buoyant revenue sources.
2. Proliferation of CSS: While the Planning Commission is gone, many CSS continue, often with conditionalities, impeding states' flexibility.
3. GST Implementation Issues: Delays in GST compensation, the central government's reliance on cesses, and the structural power imbalance in the Council remain contentious issues.

In conclusion, while recent reforms have moved towards a more collaborative model, the fundamental asymmetry in financial power persists. The shift is more in process than in the substantive redistribution of fiscal sovereignty, and the goal of a balanced fiscal federation remains a work in progress.`

    question: "What are environmental pressure groups? Discuss their role in raising awareness, influencing policies and advocating for environmental protection in India.",
    paragraph: `Environmental pressure groups are non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and citizen collectives that advocate for environmental protection, conservation, and sustainable development. They operate outside formal government structures but aim to influence public opinion and policy through research, lobbying, campaigns, and direct action.

In India, these groups play a multi-faceted role:

1. Raising Awareness: They are crucial in translating complex environmental issues into public discourse. Through public campaigns, seminars, street plays, and strategic use of media (including social media), they highlight threats like air pollution, deforestation, and wildlife crime. Groups like the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) publish extensive research, making scientific data accessible to the public and press, thereby fostering an informed citizenry.

2. Influencing Policies: Pressure groups act as a watchdog and a lobby. They engage in policy advocacy by submitting expert opinions to parliamentary committees, drafting model legislation, and lobbying with lawmakers. For instance, the sustained advocacy by groups like Kalpavriksh was instrumental in the enactment of the Forest Rights Act (2006) and the strengthening of the Wildlife Protection Act.

3. Advocating for Protection: They often resort to judicial activism, using the judiciary to enforce environmental laws. The Supreme Court's landmark interventions on issues like Delhi's air pollution (M.C. Mehta cases) and the protection of forests were largely triggered by petitions from environmental activists and groups. They also mobilize grassroots resistance against specific destructive projects, as seen in the iconic struggle against the Sardar Sarovar Dam (Narmada Bachao Andolan) and in numerous movements against mining projects.
In essence, Indian environmental pressure groups fill a critical democratic space. They amplify marginalized voices, hold the state and corporations accountable, and have been pivotal in shaping India's environmental jurisprudence and policy landscape, making environmental protection a central public concern.`

    question: "\"In contemporary development models, decision-making and problem-solving responsibilities are not located close to the source of information and execution defeating the objectives of development.\" Critically evaluate.",
    paragraph: `The statement highlights a critical flaw in top-down, centralized development models, where key decisions are made by a distant bureaucracy, far removed from the ground-level reality. This centralization often defeats the very objectives of development, namely efficiency, relevance, and empowerment.

Critical Evaluation:

1. Defeated Objectives:

• Inefficiency and Delays: Information from the field must travel up a long hierarchical chain, and decisions must travel down, causing significant delays. This makes the system slow to respond to local problems and changing circumstances.
• Irrelevance and Misallocation: Central planners often lack the contextual knowledge of local needs, resources, and cultural nuances. This leads to poorly designed, \"one-size-fits-all\" schemes that are frequently irrelevant or even harmful to the specific community, resulting in wasted resources.
• Lack of Ownership and Accountability: When communities are mere recipients of decisions made elsewhere, they feel no sense of ownership. This leads to poor maintenance of assets and a lack of accountability among both officials and beneficiaries, undermining project sustainability.

2. The Imperative for Decentralization:
The critique logically leads to the advocacy for decentralized governance, as envisioned by the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in India. Locating decision-making closer to the people—through empowered Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)—ensures that development solutions are context-specific, faster, and more accountable.

3. The Counterpoint – Need for a Balanced Approach:
A purely localized approach also has limitations. Macro-level challenges like climate change, large infrastructure projects, and national security require centralized planning and resource pooling. The ideal model is not complete decentralization but a subsidiarity principle, where decisions are taken at the lowest appropriate level, with the higher tier providing strategic guidance, resources, and ensuring equity.

Conclusion:
The statement is largely valid. Centralized decision-making, by creating a disconnect between information and action, is a major impediment to effective and sustainable development. Empowering local governance is not just an administrative choice but a prerequisite for development that is truly responsive, efficient, and inclusive. The challenge lies in forging a synergistic relationship between central authority and local autonomy.`

    question: "The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has to address the challenges faced by children in the digital era. Examine the existing policies and suggest measures the Commission can initiate to tackle the issue.",
    paragraph: `The digital era presents the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) with a dual challenge: protecting children from online harms while ensuring they can access the opportunities of the digital world. Existing policies provide a foundational, yet incomplete, framework.

Existing Policies and Gaps:

Key policies include:
• The Information Technology Act, 2000: Sections 67B criminalizes online child sexual abuse material, but it is largely reactive.
• POCSO Act, 2012: It addresses cyber grooming and pornography, but implementation in the digital space is challenging.
• Juvenile Justice Act, 2015: Recognizes children in need of care and protection(CNCP), which can include online abuse victims.

The primary gap is the absence of a dedicated, comprehensive law. Policies are fragmented and lag behind rapidly evolving threats like cyberbullying, data privacy breaches, and addictive design.

Measures NCPCR can Initiate:

1. Advocacy for a Specific Legal Framework: Champion the creation of a Digital Child Protection Code to consolidate laws, define new-age offenses, and establish accountability for tech platforms.
2. Develop a Multi-Stakeholder Strategy: Coordinate a national response involving schools, parents, tech companies, and law enforcement.
3. Promote Digital Literacy and Resilience: Mandate the integration of digital citizenship into school curricula to teach children about online risks, critical thinking, and responsible behaviour.
4. Strengthen and Integrate Grievance Redressal: The NCPCR should work to specialize the existing 1098 Childline mechanism for the digital era. This includes training responders on cyber-crimes, creating a seamless digital reporting interface, and ensuring swift coordination with cybercrime cells for investigation and victim support.

By shifting from a reactive to a proactive, rights-based approach, the NCPCR can effectively safeguard India's children in the digital age.`

    question: "\"Energy security constitutes the dominant kingpin of India's foreign policy, and is linked with India's overarching influence in Middle Eastern countries.\" How would you integrate energy security with India's foreign policy trajectories in the coming years?",
    paragraph: `Energy security, as a \"dominant kingpin,\" necessitates that India's foreign policy be strategically woven around securing reliable, affordable, and diverse energy supplies. In the coming years, this integration will manifest through multi-vector diplomacy, strategic partnerships, and a focus on the entire energy value chain.

1. Deepening Strategic Partnerships: India will move beyond a pure buyer-seller relationship with Middle Eastern partners like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This will involve leveraging strategic partnerships for investments in India’s strategic petroleum reserves, refinery infrastructure, and renewable energy projects, creating mutual interdependence.

2. Diversification of Sources and Routes: To mitigate risks, India will aggressively diversify its import basket. This includes strengthening ties with Russia despite geopolitical pressures, increasing engagement with Central Asia and Africa (e.g., Mozambique), and securing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US and Australia. Protecting sea lanes of communication in the Indian Ocean and developing alternative routes like the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) will be a key foreign policy objective.

3. Integration with Green Transition: Foreign policy will be aligned with the clean energy transition. This involves forming \"Green Strategic Partnerships\" with nations like the EU and Japan for technology transfer and joint ventures in green hydrogen, solar manufacturing, and critical minerals. Diplomacy will focus on securing access to lithium and cobalt resources in countries like Chile, Argentina, and Australia.

4. Regional Energy Integration: India will champion regional energy grids, such as the \"One Sun, One World, One Grid\" initiative and cross-border electricity trade with neighbours like Nepal and Bhutan. This positions India as a regional energy hub, enhancing its strategic influence.

In essence, India's foreign policy will be a dynamic tool to build a resilient energy ecosystem—balancing traditional suppliers with new partners, fossil fuels with renewables, and transactional deals with long-term strategic investments to fuel its economic growth.`

    question: "\"The reform process in the United Nations remains unresolved, because of the delicate imbalance of East and West and entanglement of the USA vs. Russo-Chinese alliance.\" Examine and critically evaluate the East-West policy confrontations in this regard.",
    paragraph: `The protracted deadlock in United Nations Security Council (UNSC) reform is fundamentally rooted in a geopolitical impasse between established and emerging powers, often framed as an East-West confrontation. The core of this stalemate is the clash over expansion and veto power. The United States and its Western allies, while selectively supporting candidates like India, are reluctant to dilute the Council’s efficacy—a euphemism for their own influence. Conversely, the Russo-Chinese alliance actively obstructs reforms that would diminish their privileged status, viewing them as a Western strategy to consolidate a liberal order. This is evident in China’s opposition to the G4 proposals and the recurrent use of the veto to block resolutions on Syria and Myanmar, underscoring a deep ideological divide between sovereignty-centric and interventionist doctrines.

However, reducing the blockage solely to this bipolar rivalry offers an incomplete picture. A critical evaluation reveals that collective P5 privilege is the more profound barrier; all permanent members, East or West, benefit from the status quo and resist diluting their exclusive power. Furthermore, the North-South divide complicates the consensus, as exemplified by the African Union’s Ezulwini Consensus demanding equitable representation, which sometimes clashes with Asian aspirations. The consensus-based Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) process, lacking a definitive text, institutionalizes this inertia.

Thus, UNSC reform is trapped between the urgency for representational legitimacy and the inertia of structural oligarchy. The challenge is not merely reconciling East-West rivalries but negotiating a grand bargain that addresses the vested interests of the P5 while accommodating the legitimate aspirations of the Global South. Without this, the UN risks escalating irrelevance in managing 21st-century global security.`

    question: "Inequality in the ownership pattern of resources is one of the major cause of poverty. Discuss in the context of 'paradox of poverty'.",
    paragraph: `The \"paradox of poverty\" refers to the persistent existence of widespread deprivation amidst overall economic growth and an increase in aggregate national wealth. In this context, the highly unequal ownership pattern of key resources—primarily land, capital, and human capital—is not just a correlate but a fundamental cause of poverty, creating a self-perpetuating cycle.

The Causal Link Between Ownership Inequality and Poverty:

In an agrarian economy like India's, land is the primary source of livelihood. A highly skewed land ownership pattern, where a small minority owns large tracts while a vast majority are landless or marginal farmers, means that the benefits of agricultural growth are narrowly concentrated. The landless poor, lacking assets, are forced into low-wage labour, unable to generate surplus or build wealth.

This extends to the modern economy through unequal ownership of capital (factories, machinery, financial assets) and human capital (education, skills). The wealthy can invest capital to generate more income, while the poor, lacking access to quality education and financial resources, remain confined to low-skill, low-wage employment. They cannot afford to invest in their children's human capital, thus reproducing intergenerational poverty.

The \"Paradox\" Explained:

The paradox arises because aggregate economic growth, driven by the productive use of resources by the wealthy, does not automatically \"trickle down\" to the asset-poor. A country's GDP may rise, but if the ownership of the resources generating that GDP is concentrated, the income and wealth generated are also concentrated. The poor, lacking productive assets, cannot significantly participate in or benefit from the growth process. They remain in poverty, acting as a reserve army of labour, which further suppresses wages.

Therefore, without direct state intervention to redistribute assets (e.g., land reforms) or their benefits (via progressive taxation, quality public education, and healthcare), the structural inequality in resource ownership ensures that poverty persists as a paradoxical feature of a growing economy.`
