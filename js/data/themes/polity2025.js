            question: 'Discuss the 'corrupt practices' for the purpose of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Analyze whether the increase in the assets of the legislators and/or their associates, disproportionate to their known sources of income, would constitute 'undue influence' and consequently a corrupt practice. 150 words',
            paragraph: 'The Representation of the People Act, 1951 seeks to ensure free and fair elections by prohibiting practices that distort the voter’s free will. Corrupt practices are those acts that undermine the purity of the electoral process.

As per Section 123 of the Act, the following constitute corrupt practices:

1. Bribery – Offering or accepting gratification to influence voting behaviour.


2. Undue influence – Interfering with the free exercise of the voter’s choice through threat or coercion.


3. Appeal on religious, caste, communal, or linguistic grounds to secure votes.


4. Publication of false statements regarding a candidate’s personal character or conduct.


5. Misuse of government machinery for electioneering purposes.


6. Hiring or procuring vehicles for voters and exceeding prescribed election expenses.



An increase in the assets of legislators or their associates, disproportionate to their known income, does not automatically amount to a corrupt practice, unless it is proven that the wealth was used to exercise undue influence or inducement over voters. Such enrichment, though unethical, is dealt with under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and not Section 123 of the RPA.
