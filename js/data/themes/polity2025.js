            question: 'Discuss the \'corrupt practices\' for the purpose of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Analyze whether the increase in the assets of the legislators and/or their associates, disproportionate to their known sources of income, would constitute \'undue influence\' and consequently a corrupt practice. 150 words',
            paragraph: `The Representation of the People Act, 1951 seeks to ensure free and fair elections by prohibiting practices that distort the voter's free will. Corrupt practices are those acts that undermine the purity of the electoral process.

As per Section 123 of the Act, the following constitute corrupt practices:

1. Bribery – Offering or accepting gratification to influence voting behaviour.

2. Undue influence – Interfering with the free exercise of the voter's choice through threat or coercion.

3. Appeal on religious, caste, communal, or linguistic grounds to secure votes.

4. Publication of false statements regarding a candidate's personal character or conduct.

5. Misuse of government machinery for electioneering purposes.

6. Hiring or procuring vehicles for voters and exceeding prescribed election expenses.

An increase in the assets of legislators or their associates, disproportionate to their known income, does not automatically amount to a corrupt practice, unless it is proven that the wealth was used to exercise undue influence or inducement over voters. Such enrichment, though unethical, is dealt with under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and not Section 123 of the RPA.`

    question: 'Comment on the need of administrative tribunals as compared to the court system. Assess the impact of the recent tribunal reforms through rationalization of tribunals made in 2021. 150 words.',
    paragraph: `Administrative tribunals were created to ensure speedy, specialized, and less formal adjudication in administrative and service-related disputes. The regular courts, burdened with delays and procedural rigidity, often failed to provide timely justice in such matters. Tribunals thus act as quasi-judicial bodies combining legal and technical expertise, promoting efficiency and accessibility.

Need for tribunals compared to courts:

1. Specialized expertise – Subject-matter experts handle complex technical cases.

2. Speed and efficiency – Simplified procedures and reduced backlog.

3. Affordability – Less costly and time-consuming than traditional litigation.

4. Judicial relief – Reduces the burden on constitutional courts.

The Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, aimed to rationalize the system by merging tribunals with overlapping functions, streamlining appointments, and standardizing service conditions. While this reform enhanced administrative efficiency, critics argue it reduced judicial independence by vesting greater control with the executive, thereby raising concerns about separation of powers under Article 50.`

    question: 'Compare and contrast the President\'s power to pardon in India and in the USA. Are there any limits to it in both the countries? What are \'preemptive pardons\'?',
    paragraph: `In India, the President’s power to grant pardons is derived from Article 72 of the Constitution. It extends to offences under Union laws, court-martial cases, and death sentences. The President acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, making the power not absolute. Judicial review is allowed if the decision is arbitrary, mala fide, or discriminatory, as affirmed in Maru Ram v. Union of India (1980).

In contrast, the U.S. President enjoys broader clemency powers under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. The American President can independently grant reprieves, commutations, or pardons for federal offences, except in cases of impeachment. The courts generally cannot review the exercise of this power, giving it a near-absolute character.

Preemptive pardons are those granted before formal charges or conviction, effectively protecting individuals from future prosecution, as famously seen in President Ford’s pardon of Nixon.`

    question: 'Discuss the nature of Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly after the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019. Briefly describe the powers and functions of the Assembly of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.',
    paragraph: `The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 transformed the erstwhile state into two Union Territories — Jammu and Kashmir (with a Legislative Assembly) and Ladakh (without one). Consequently, the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir functions more like that of Delhi or Puducherry, operating under Article 239A and Section 14 of the Act.

Nature of the Assembly:

It is a unicameral body, replacing the earlier bicameral legislature.

The Lieutenant Governor (LG) is the constitutional head, while the Council of Ministers, led by a Chief Minister, aids and advises the LG except on reserved subjects such as public order, police, and land.

The Assembly’s term is five years, unlike the six-year term of the former state assembly.

Powers and functions:

It can make laws on State List and Concurrent List subjects (except those reserved for Parliament).

It exercises oversight on the executive, controls finances through budget approval, and represents local aspirations within the federal framework.`
