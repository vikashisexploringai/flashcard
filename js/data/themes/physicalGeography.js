    question: "How are the fjords formed? Why do they constitute some of the most picturesque areas of the world.",
    paragraph: `Formation of Fjords:

Fjords are deep, glacially-carved valleys flooded by the sea. They form through a multi-stage process:

1. Glacial Carving: During ice ages, massive glaciers flow down existing river valleys or tectonic fault lines. The immense weight and abrasive action of the ice (carrying rock debris) deepen, widen, and straighten these valleys into steep-sided, U-shaped troughs, often far below sea level.
2. Sea Flooding: As the glaciers later retreat (melt) due to climatic warming, the global sea level rises. The ocean invades and floods the deep, empty glacial troughs, creating long, narrow, and incredibly deep saltwater inlets.

Why They Are So Picturesque:

Fjords combine dramatic geological scales with serene beauty, creating world-renowned scenery:

1. Sheer Scale & Drama: Their defining feature is the stark contrast between towering, steep rock walls (often rising 1000+ meters vertically from the water) and the deep, placid blue or emerald waters below. This creates a breathtaking sense of grandeur and depth.
2. Pristine Wilderness: Found in remote, high-latitude regions (Norway, New Zealand, Chile, Canada), fjords are often surrounded by untouched landscapes—waterfalls cascading down cliffs, ancient glaciers clinging to mountains, and lush green vegetation at the water's edge.
3. Tranquil Complexity: Their serpentine, branching structure creates ever-changing vistas. Calm waters reflect the mountains and sky, while the interplay of light and shadow across the deep valleys adds a mystical quality. The mix of snow, rock, forest, and sea in one frame epitomizes pristine natural beauty.

In essence, fjords are picturesque because they showcase the raw, sculpting power of ice ages combined with the calming, reflective presence of the sea, all set within remote and rugged wilderness—a visually powerful union of geological force and serene beauty.`
