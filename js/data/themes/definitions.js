    paragraph: `Science is the systematic study of the natural world through observation and experimentation to build organized knowledge, aiming to understand how and why things work, produce testable explanations, and make predictions about the universe. It's both a process (the scientific method) and the body of knowledge gained from that process, covering everything from atoms to galaxies.`
